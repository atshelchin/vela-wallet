//! The Windows WebAuthn API — the one place the wallet asks an operating
//! system to run a passkey ceremony on its behalf.
//!
//! ## Why this exists at all
//!
//! Everywhere else, the desktop client talks to security keys itself, because
//! no desktop offers it a passkey service. Windows is the exception, and not by
//! preference: **since Windows 10 build 1903 a non-elevated process cannot open
//! a FIDO HID device.** The OS reserves them for `webauthn.dll`. That is why
//! `libfido2` uses this same API on Windows rather than its own HID backend,
//! and why `fido-key-manager` ships an elevation manifest — asking someone to
//! run their wallet as Administrator is not an answer.
//!
//! So for a key **on the USB port**, the platform's CTAP client is the only
//! route. Everything `ctap/usb.rs` does on macOS and Linux — choosing a device,
//! the touch prompt, the PIN prompt, enumerating credentials, the picker —
//! Windows does itself, in its own dialog. That is a smaller surface, not a
//! bigger one.
//!
//! ## What this crate is NOT for
//!
//! **The phone.** The lockdown is on FIDO HID devices, and the hybrid (caBLE)
//! transport touches none: it is a BLE advertisement scan and a WebSocket, both
//! of which a non-elevated process may do. So `ctap/cable.rs` runs on Windows
//! exactly as it does on the other two desktops, and `KeyMethod::Hybrid` never
//! reaches this crate. That matters beyond tidiness — `webauthn.dll` only grew
//! its own QR flow in Windows 11 22H2, so delegating the phone here would leave
//! every Windows 10 machine with no way to sign in from a phone at all.
//!
//! ## One dialog per method, not one dialog for all three
//!
//! The wallet asks the person to choose — security key, phone, or this device —
//! on a screen it draws itself, and that choice must survive into whatever
//! Windows shows next. So every call carries an [`Attachment`]:
//!
//! * `SecurityKey` → `CROSS_PLATFORM`. Windows Hello stays out of the dialog.
//! * `ThisDevice` → `PLATFORM`. Windows Hello, and nothing else.
//!
//! What the attachment CANNOT do is take the phone out of the `SecurityKey`
//! dialog, because hybrid is itself a cross-platform attachment. At API version
//! 7 there is no transport filter and no credential hints on the
//! make-credential options, so a registration dialog on Windows 11 22H2+ may
//! still offer "use your phone" beside the security key. An assertion for a
//! KNOWN credential is pinned harder — its allow-list entry names the wire —
//! and the discoverable-credential sign-in has no allow list and so no lever.
//! Closing that last gap means not using `webauthn.dll` for the USB port at
//! all; see the CCID note in the feature's `ctap-client-surface.md`.
//!
//! ## What is NOT delegated
//!
//! The clientDataJSON. Windows takes it as a byte buffer and hashes it; it does
//! not build it. So the same `client_data_json()` this wallet uses for CTAP2
//! builds it here too, and the join with the core's parsers — the property that
//! a key minted on any platform derives the same address — survives untouched.
//!
//! ## Pointer discipline
//!
//! Every `WEBAUTHN_*` request struct holds bare pointers into buffers this
//! crate owns. They are held in `Pin<Box<..>>` and kept alive across the call
//! by name, never by luck: a temporary that drops at the end of its statement
//! leaves the API reading freed memory. The shape is borrowed from
//! `webauthn-authenticator-rs`, which learned it the same way everyone does.
//!
//! ## Verification status
//!
//! **Type-checked for Windows, never run on it.** Nobody on this project has a
//! Windows machine yet. Every struct field and signature below is checked by
//! `cargo check --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`; none of the behaviour is
//! confirmed. Treat the first run on real hardware as the real review.
