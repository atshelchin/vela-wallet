//! The half of the architecture that **performs**.
//!
//! `vela-core` decides and asks; the shell does. On desktop there is no bridge
//! and no JSON in between: `Core<A>` runs in this process, so an operation
//! arrives as a Rust enum and an answer goes back as one. What is preserved
//! from the wasm bridge is not the encoding but the CORRELATION RULES, because
//! those are where a driver gets subtly wrong:
//!
//! 1. Effect ids are monotonic, per core instance.
//! 2. An id this host does not know means **the answer outlived the question** —
//!    an operation that was already abandoned. Expected, not a fault: report
//!    nothing and change nothing.
//! 3. A `resolve` error means the command that owned the request was aborted
//!    before the answer arrived. Same story, one layer down.
//!
//! None of the three is a bug, none should reach a user, and all three are why
//! this file exists once and is generic over the machine rather than being
//! written per screen.

// Why there is no `cancelled_effect_ids` here
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The wasm bridge carries that field and it is always empty, for a reason that
// is a property of the MACHINES rather than of the transport: each pipeline
// keeps at most one operation in flight and stamps every request with the
// attempt that asked for it, so a superseded answer is dropped by the core on
// arrival instead of being aborted by the shell. A desktop executor that
// implemented cancellation would therefore be implementing a path the core
// never takes — and would need a second, different reason to be correct.
//
// The one operation that genuinely takes unbounded time is a passkey ceremony
// waiting for a finger on a security key. That is bounded by the CTAPHID
// timeout in `ctap::usb`, which answers with a failure result rather than
// leaving the core waiting — the same shape every other failure takes.
