// Ported from src/services/wallet-state-core/token-trust-resident.ts @ c13e89d4 (spec 025).
/**
 * The resident `token_trust` session — WEB (spec 017, group G7).
 *
 * `token_trust` is an app-lifetime machine, not a screen-lifetime one: the
 * trusted-token set it builds is shared by the receive scanner, the auto-add
 * admission and the sign-sheet preview, and the whole point of unifying them
 * is that they see ONE set. So a single module-level session is created on
 * first use and never disposed — the `use-display-currency.web.ts` pattern,
 * scaled up.
 *
 * This module owns no rules. It is the shell half of the machine:
 *  - it pushes the four snapshot events the core cannot fetch for itself
 *    (held chains, held tokens, registry tokens, custom tokens),
 *  - it turns two of the core's view fields into the promise-shaped calls the
 *    existing TypeScript call sites expect, and
 *  - it serialises callers per pipeline so the core's "latest wins" sim
 *    session and single-flight poll are never raced from this side.
 *
 * Nothing here decides what happens next; every branch below is either a wire
 * translation or a wait.
