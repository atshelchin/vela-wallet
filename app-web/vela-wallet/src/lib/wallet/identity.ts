/**
 * Whose wallet this is — swapped into the fixture model at runtime (spec 019).
 *
 * The wallet body is still the spec-015 fixture layer. Two things in it are
 * NOT allowed to be fixtures once somebody is signed in: the address, because
 * it is the one value on the page a person acts on, and the name, because it
 * is the line they read as "this is mine". The other three clients do exactly
 * this swap (`withAddress`/`withName` on the phones, `Identity` on the
 * desktop); this is the web's copy of it.
 *
 * Blank identity is a real state, not a bug: the page is prerendered before
 * anyone is signed in, and a prerendered fixture address would flash a
 * stranger's wallet at the person for one frame after hydration. So the
 * server ships an EMPTY header and the browser fills it.
