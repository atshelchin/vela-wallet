/**
 * Incoming-transfer discovery — WEB, driven by the `token_trust` core
 * (spec 017, `rust/crates/vela-core/src/app/token_trust.rs`).
 *
 * Replaces `transfer-monitor.ts`'s decision half on web: the per-chain
 * allowlist, the probe + single capped retry, the local `topics[2]`
 * re-verification, the timestamp cap and the metadata gate are all the core's
 * now. What is left here is the call shape `activity.ts` expects and the wire
 * translation of the machine's judged feed.
 *
 * Two honest differences from the TypeScript monitor, both benign downstream:
 *
 *  - The answer is the machine's whole de-duped feed for this account, not
 *    just this tick's window. `activity.ts` merges by the same stable id, so a
 *    repeat is a no-op and a row that only became renderable on a later poll
 *    still lands.
 *  - An ERC-20 whose metadata never resolved is withheld by the core
 *    (invariant ③) instead of being returned and dropped by `activity.ts`'s
 *    own index filter. Same rows reach the store either way; the core's is the
 *    earlier gate.
